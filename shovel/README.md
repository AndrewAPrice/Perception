# Shovel

Shovel is a dynamically typed high level language. Tools related to Shovel go in here.

# Status
- The assembler is done.
- The compiler is in progress.
- No virtual machine yet.

# What's all this Javascript?

A lot of these tools are written in Javascript. I wrote these tools in Javascript (specifically to run under Node.js) because Javascript is very close in syntax and functionality to Shovel. Once the toolchain and virtual machine are mature enough, I plan to port these tools natively to Shovel, creating a self hosting system.

I try to avoid using Javascript features (like prototypes) that are currently not planned for Shovel.
